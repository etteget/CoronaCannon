# Corona Cannon with a bit of Graphical Level Editing

This is a fork from Corona Cannon. Original version of the example
game has map editing capabilities. In this try out an UI was written
for those capabilities. In addition, the purpose was to try out some
things to find the best ways to develop game using Corona. All changes /
additions to the original CoronaCannon can be found out using git diff.
This file has a short summary of the changes.

Note - the original Corona Cannon level editor, as well as this code,
edits lua files in levels directory. Meaning that this is not Tiled editor
but an editor for the format that is used in the lua files in that directory.
